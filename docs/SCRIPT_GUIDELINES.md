The Echo Tape: An Interactive Script
A story of stoner psychodrama and fractured reality.

Style: Disco Elysium meets David Lynch. A narrative-heavy experience where player choices, internal thoughts, and the consequences of every action drive the story. The world is gritty, the dialogue is sharp, and the line between profound insight and drug-fueled paranoia is dangerously thin.

Dramatis Personae:

NARRATOR: The voice of the world, guiding the players through the unfolding mystery. Its tone is intimate, conspiratorial, and occasionally unreliable, reflecting the characters' fracturing perceptions. It speaks directly to the players, detailing not just actions but the internal monologues of their characters, the hum of their anxieties, and the texture of their reality as it dissolves.

JOE (Player 1): The Anchor. His psyche is a battleground between Pragmatism—the voice of his Home Office job that demands logical explanations—and Anomalous Dread, the gut feeling that the rules no longer apply. He seeks patterns in the chaos, but what if the pattern is chaos itself? He's grounded, but the ground is starting to feel like quicksand.

NEWT (Player 2): The Catalyst. 22, an unemployed, budding musician with the chaotic, gentle energy of Mac Miller. He lives in a house-share with his two cats, Gooby and Doobie, who seem to operate on a different existential plane. He is a chaos agent, a lightning rod for the surreal, driven by raw intuition and a deep connection to the frequencies of the world. He doesn't just hear music; he feels the vibrations of reality itself—the static between moments, the hum of a forgotten memory. This makes him both a prophet and a prime target for whatever is unfolding.

ACT I: The Glitch in the System
SCENE 1

INT. HOME OFFICE / NEWT'S FLAT - DAY

TUESDAY, 11:42 AM

NARRATOR
The world begins with a hum. For JOE, it's the oppressive, maddening buzz of a fluorescent light strip in the sterile, soul-crushing quiet of the Liverpool Home Office. The air tastes of recycled oxygen, lukewarm coffee, and quiet desperation. A database on his screen is frozen, a digital tombstone for productivity: "PROPERTY VERIFICATION – NORTHWEST SECTOR C-42". It’s been stuck for an hour, mocking him. In a dusty drawer, nestled between forgotten case files that smell of decaying paper and regret, his fingers brush against something cold, angular, and plastic. A VHS tape. A single Post-it note clings to it, the biro faded to a ghostly blue: "DO NOT WATCH ALONE."

For NEWT, the hum is the low, resonant purr of his cat, Gooby, a warm, black weight perched on his chest as he blinks himself awake on the living room floor. The room smells of old incense, the ghost of last night's smoke, and the faint, sweet scent of cold pizza. A half-finished blunt lies in a nearby ashtray like a fallen soldier. His phone vibrates against the floorboards, insistently playing a voice memo from "GRANNY (REAL ONE?)". The voice is a metallic whisper, distorted as if recorded through a copper pipe, cutting through the morning haze with an unnerving clarity.

GRANNY (V.O.)
(Static crackles like fire around the edges of the words)
"Tell Joe... the property isn't listed anymore. The lines on the map have forgotten it... Because it's not... real anymore. Not entirely. Don't go looking. It looks back."

The message names a location: Larkhill Lane—the exact same street name burning a hole in Joe's frozen work file, a phantom place linking two separate worlds.

NARRATOR
The scene is set. Two threads, pulling from different ends of the city, are about to cross, woven together by a glitch in the fabric of the mundane. The universe has made a typo, and you are the only ones who have noticed.

PLAYER CHOICE:

JOE: Your Pragmatism skill insists this is junk, a distraction from a job you already hate. Fix the database. Your Anomalous Dread, however, whispers that this object has gravity, that ignoring it is a choice you will regret forever. Which voice do you obey?

NEWT: Do you dismiss the voice memo as just another cryptic message from the beautiful, strange mind of your housemate, another piece of psychic driftwood? Or do you feel a cold spike of significance, a note of truth in the static, and call Joe immediately?

SCENE 2

INT. JOE'S FLAT - AFTERNOON

NARRATOR
The decision is made. Joe, the anomalous tape a heavy, solid presence in his bag, has escaped the office. Newt is on a bus, the cryptic message echoing in his mind, the words feeling heavier and more significant with each passing street. They convene at Joe's flat, a sanctuary of ordered clutter that smells faintly and comfortingly of weed. Before the mystery can be addressed, the ritual must be observed. A fresh bag of Echo Kush is unpacked, its pungent, earthy aroma filling the room like a prayer. The bongs are filled, the water bubbling a soft, percussive welcome. The air grows thick, heavy, and sacred as they prepare to dive in.

Finally, with a shared, nervous glance that says "fuck it" in a way words never could, they press play.

The tape doesn't show a movie. It doesn't show static. It shows a CCTV view of Newt, just moments ago, standing outside the corner shop, exhaling a plume of vape smoke. The quality is grainy, the colors bled out like an old photograph, but it's unmistakably him. The timestamp in the corner reads: OCTOBER 23, 2014. Time glitches, folding in on itself with a nauseating lurch. The cats, Gooby and Doobie, who had been lazily washing themselves, now sit bolt upright, their bodies tense, staring at the screen as if it's a window to somewhere they know. In Newt's mind, a familiar feline voice, clear as a bell and twice as unsettling, cuts through the high.

GOOBY (TELEPATHICALLY)
"Be careful, Newt. The signal is unstable. It's bleeding through. Don't trust Joe's logic. Not yet. He’s still decoding with the wrong part of his brain. He's looking for an answer, not the truth."

PLAYER CHOICE:

JOE: Your mind, the one you rely on, screams that this is impossible. Do you try to rationalize the timestamp, blaming a faulty player, a doctored tape, anything that fits into the neat boxes of your world? Or do you lean into the weirdness, take another deep, lung-burning pull from the bong, and accept that the rules have irrevocably changed?

NEWT: That was not a thought. That was a voice, as real as the bong in your hand. Do you tell Joe what Gooby just "said," risking that he'll think you've finally lost it? Or do you keep the psychic cat message to yourself, a secret key to a lock you don't yet understand, your first piece of evidence in a case no one else knows is open?

ACT II: The Party at the End of Reality
SCENE 3

INT. JOE'S FLAT - NIGHT

NARRATOR
Faced with an ontological paradox that defies all reason, Joe and Newt do the only logical thing: they throw a party. If reality is going to break, they might as well turn up the music and invite some friends to watch. The flat transforms from a sanctuary to a psychedelic haven, a lighthouse in a sea of encroaching strangeness. Guests arrive in waves of chaotic energy: Charlie Pollard in a sequined cape and sunglasses, despite it being 10 PM; Psychedelic Granny (Skylar) carrying what appears to be a laser harp in a velvet case; and a quiet, unassuming man who introduces himself as Sam, visiting from the U.S. Then, from the toilet, emerges a stranger with a full DJ rig, who wordlessly sets up and floods the room with deep, hypnotic bass, as if he was summoned.

Amid the swirling lights and rising smoke, Newt senses a profound wrongness emanating from "Sam." He's too placid, his smile a perfect, unmoving curve that doesn't touch his eyes. He is a glitch in the room's energy. Newt, his senses heightened by a fresh tab of acid Joe provided, decides to test him with a shared memory, a sacred story from a disastrous trip to Manchester that is theirs and theirs alone.

"SAM"
(Voice flat, devoid of warmth, unblinking)
"I do not recall that incident. I have never been to Manchester. My records indicate I have always been in Ohio."

NARRATOR
The word "records" hangs in the air, cold and sharp. Newt, peaking and propelled by a wave of righteous paranoia, tackles "Sam." There's no impact. Newt's hands pass through the image with a sound like tearing cellophane and a flash of blinding static. The air instantly smells of hot plastic and burnt sugar. The psychic reverb hits Newt like a physical blow, making his teeth ache and the music suddenly sound like it's being played backwards from the bottom of a well. The shockwave sends Newt into a full-blown bad trip. Convinced the answer lies outside the confines of the flat, he strips naked and sprints out the door, a primal scream tearing from his lungs.

NEWT
(Screaming into the night)
"I'M GONNA FIND OUT WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON, BRO!"

PLAYER CHOICE:

JOE: The party has just witnessed a man disappear into static. The vibe has shifted from fun to fundamentally terrifying. Do you try to calm everyone down, to rationalize the event as a group hallucination, a shared trip? Or do you grab the portable DJ rig, recognizing that the only way through this is to embrace the madness and chase after your friend into the abyss?

NEWT: You are sprinting, the cold night air a shock against your skin, the city a blur of lights and sound that feels both threatening and beautiful. Do you head for the familiar chaos of the city center, a place of comforting anonymity? Or do you let your instincts guide you, a strange magnetic pull in your gut, towards the rumored, non-existent location of Larkhill Lane?

ACT III: The Doorway on Larkhill Lane
SCENE 4

EXT. LARKHILL LANE - NIGHT

NARRATOR
The chase culminates at Larkhill Lane—a street that shouldn't exist, but does, shimmering at the edge of perception like a heat haze on a cold night. The houses are warped, leaning into each other as if sharing a terrible secret. The air hums with a low-frequency static that you can feel in your teeth, a sound that feels like a memory. The party follows, a bizarre procession of mystics and stoners, turning the phantom street into a spontaneous, naked rave. Joe, now also naked and inspired, live-commentates the scene like a psychedelic sportscaster, his voice looping through the DJ rig, creating a bizarre, self-referential soundtrack to the end of the world.

As the energy peaks, as the dancing becomes a form of frantic prayer to a god they didn't know existed, the ground vibrates. A single, black, wooden door rises from the center of an overgrown roundabout. It is not attached to anything. It simply is. A sliver of impossible light leaks from the crack, and you can hear the faint, rhythmic sound of breathing from the other side. It breathes in time with the bass.

NARRATOR
Skylar whispers that this is where "Sam" came from, a tear in the fabric. This is what the tape was for. The door beckons, a silent invitation to leave the known world behind. It is a choice, presented as a destination.

PLAYER CHOICE:

Do you, as a group, decide to enter the door, accepting the consequences of stepping into the unknown, of becoming part of the tape?

Or do you try to destroy the door, to burn it down and end the mystery here and now, even if it means never knowing the truth and possibly trapping yourselves on the wrong side of reality?

SCENE 5

INT. THE RECORDING STUDIO - BEYOND TIME

NARRATOR
You step through, and the door vanishes. Or maybe it was never there. The world you left behind is gone, erased with a sound like a tape being wiped clean. You're in a hallway now. The walls aren't walls; they're you. Moving film, flickering with every memory you've ever had and a few you're pretty sure belong to someone else. There's you, as a kid, scraping your knee. There's you, on a date that never happened. It's all real. It's all tape. At the end of the hall is another door, pulsing with a faint, internal light, like a sleeping heart.

Behind it lies a surreal recording studio. An older, hollow-eyed version of Joe sits on a stool, holding a VHS tape. Beside him, a version of Newt flickers like a weak signal, a ghost in the machine. The walls are not walls, but stacks of humming reel-to-reel players, their tapes spooling endlessly, showing fragmented footage from inside your minds.

OLDER JOE
(Voice raspy, tired, and echoing as if from the tape itself)
"You’ve looped. Again. This place... it's built from your experiences. You've been feeding the project with memories, moments, fears, laughs. Every vape hit, every freestyle, every time you questioned reality—you were recording. Filling the tapes. And now, you’re here again. Ready to ask the question you always ask."

PLAYER CHOICE:

You must ask one question. The question that defines this loop. The question that you hope, this time, will change the outcome. What is it? Is it "What is this place?" or "Who are you?" or "How do we get out?" The question itself may be the key.

NARRATOR
You ask why you keep coming back. The older Joe smiles, a sad, knowing expression that holds the weight of a thousand loops. It's a smile of pity, not triumph. He touches a glowing red RECORD button on the console.

OLDER JOE (V.O.)
"Because you haven’t recorded the ending yet."

Reality dissolves into a blinding, roaring storm of white noise, the sound of a million channels at once.

ACT IV: The Loop
SCENE 6

INT. JOE'S FLAT - THE NEXT MORNING

NARRATOR
You awaken on the floor of Joe's flat. The party is over, the guests are gone, vanished as if they were never there, leaving only the faintest scent of patchouli and spilled beer. The sun is shining, casting long shadows across the debris. It feels like a normal morning after a particularly heavy night. But the haunted VHS tape is missing.

A knock at the door. Sharp. Deliberate. Three times. The sound cuts through the silence like a stone. No one is there. On the mat lies a package wrapped in old, yellowed waxed paper, tied with a length of glistening cassette tape. Inside is a new VHS, labeled in familiar, faded biro: "A Stroke On It: Final Cut."

You play it. Of course you do. The loop demands it.

The screen shows you. Right now. In the flat, sitting on the floor, the bong between you. But on the TV's version of the room, there is an open door behind you, a door that isn't there in reality. A dark figure watches from within. In the corner of the screen, a single red light blinks: REC. The observer is being observed.

You spiral, questioning if you are real, or if you are both just fragments in someone else's recording, actors in a play you don't remember auditioning for. As you try to offer a bong hit to the watchers on the screen, the tape flickers. It no longer shows the flat. It now shows a bleak, windswept field under a grey, unforgiving sky. A VHS camera is half-buried in the damp dirt, its lens like a dead eye. Next to it, a child's chalk drawing on a flat stone reads: "THE END IS WHERE YOU RECORD IT."

And beside that, half-hidden in the long, wet grass, is a final tape. It is labeled with a single, stark word: "STOP."

FINAL ACT: Your Ending to Record
NARRATOR
The loop has been revealed. The pieces are on the board, smelling of ozone and old plastic. The screen is watching you, the camera in the field is waiting, and the tape offers a choice that feels like both a promise and a threat. Outside your window, the figure that looked like Sam stands perfectly still, an unmoving sentinel at the edge of your perception, waiting for your next move. He is a part of the set. He is waiting for his cue.

The story is nearing its conclusion, but it's an ending that must be recorded. By you. The power is yours. To stop. To play. To rewind. Or to create something new entirely. The tape is rolling. What do you do?

FINAL PLAYER CHOICE:

A) The STOP Tape: Do you find a way to get to the field? Is it a real place or a state of mind? Do you dig up the STOP tape? Do you play it, risking that it erases everything, including yourselves, from the cosmic tape? Do you destroy it, defying the rules of the game and trapping yourselves in the loop forever?

B) The RECORD Button: Do you reject the premise of their game entirely? Decide that the only way to truly end the loop is to overwrite it with your own conscious creation. Find a camera, any camera, and press RECORD. What do you film? A new ending of hope or despair? An alternate present? Or just two friends, smoking a bong, finally at peace? You become the architects of your reality—or your delusion.

C) The Watcher: Do you decide the key is not the tape, but the observer? Do you confront the figure of "Sam" outside? Is he a jailer, a guide, or just another recording? Do you invite him in, attack him, or try to understand what he represents, knowing he might be the source of it all?

D) The Mundane Exit: Do you choose to believe it was all a trip, a shared psychosis of epic proportions? Do you turn everything off, smash the tape, clean the flat, and try to live a normal life, forever ignoring the hum beneath the surface of things, the flicker at the edge of your vision? Can you truly go back?

The choice is yours. The tape is rolling.
