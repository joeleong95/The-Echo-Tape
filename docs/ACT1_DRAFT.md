[SCENE START]

TITLE CARD: LARKHILL LANE

PROLOGUE - TUESDAY, 11:42 AM

EXT. LIVERPOOL - DAY

Rain streaks down the grimy windows of a council building. The sky is a uniform, defeated grey.

INT. HOME OFFICE, LIVERPOOL - DAY

GAME UI:

CHARACTER: JOE

STATUS: NUMB

OBJECTIVE: Review Case File (STALLED)

JOE, a man with a stocky frame and tightly buzzed hair, sits at his terminal. His eyes are sharp, but they carry the weary warmth of someone who has faked a smile at too many office birthdays. A tattoo of an intricate circuit board peeks out from under the cuff of his shirt.

On his screen is a frozen database. The header reads: PROPERTY VERIFICATION ‚Äì NORTHWEST SECTOR C-42. The mouse cursor is a frozen hourglass.

A faint, tonal hum begins in his headset, a bizarre whistle like Morse code tapped out through broken teeth.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - JOE)

[PERCEPTION (HEARING) - FAILED]: It‚Äôs just feedback. Server hum. Ignore it.

[INLAND EMPIRE - SUCCESS]: It‚Äôs not a server. It‚Äôs a signal. It‚Äôs a voice from a place with no mouth. Listen closer.

Joe ignores the feeling and opens the bottom drawer of his desk, searching for the case file. His fingers brush against something that isn't cardboard. He pulls it out. It's a dusty VHS tape in a plain paper sleeve. No markings. No case number. Just a yellowed Post-it note stuck to it, the words written in cheap biro:

"DO NOT WATCH ALONE."

INT. NEWT'S FLAT, TUEBROOK - SAME TIME

GAME UI:

CHARACTER: NEWT

STATUS: GROGGY

OBJECTIVE: ???

NEWT is sprawled on his living room floor, just waking up. Long blonde hair is half-tied in a messy knot, falling across his face. A slim gold chain rests against his collarbone. The blunt in the ashtray beside him is still faintly warm.

GOOBY, a fluffy ginger cat, is perched on his chest, staring at him with an expression of profound, silent judgment. DOOBIE, a sleek black cat, flicks her tail impatiently against the leg of a worn, second-hand sofa.

Newt's phone buzzes on the floor. It plays a voice memo automatically. The contact ID reads: ‚ÄúGRANNY (REAL ONE?)‚Äù

A metallic, whispering voice fills the air, thin and cold like foil.

GRANNY (V.O.)
Tell Joe the property isn't listed anymore. Because it's not... real anymore. Not entirely.

Static crackles. Then, a single, clear phrase.

GRANNY (V.O.)
Larkhill Lane.

The name hangs in the air. The street from Joe's glitching file. The one that, according to the system, shouldn't exist.

SPLIT SCREEN

LEFT: Joe, in the dusty, silent records room of the Home Office, his hand hovering over the PLAY button of an old VHS player. He has the tape halfway inserted. The machine hums, as if in anticipation.

RIGHT: Newt, grabbing his hoodie. He shoves his feet into his trainers as Gooby and Doobie watch him from the sofa, their gazes intense, unblinking. They look like they know he won't be coming back the same person.

(FADE TO BLACK)

SCENE 1: THE SYNCHRONICITY

GAME UI:

OBJECTIVE: UNDERSTAND.

INT. HOME OFFICE, RECORDS ROOM - 11:45 AM

The air is stale with the smell of decaying paper. Joe is crouched beside the humming VHS player, his thumb hesitating over the eject button. He feels a strange pull to just push the tape in and hit play. He fights it. He presses play.

The screen flickers to life. It‚Äôs not grainy, decade-old footage. It‚Äôs a crisp, clear, real-time CCTV view of a street corner.

CUT TO: EXT. TUEBROOK BUS STOP - SAME TIME

Newt stands outside a corner shop, exhaling a plume of warm smoke into the spring air. His grin is sharp, sly, filled with a glint of mischief. It's the same look he gets when he lands a perfect freestyle. He doesn't know he's being watched.

BACK IN THE RECORDS ROOM:

Joe stares at the screen. It's Newt. Right now. But then, on the TV, Newt turns his head slowly, as if hearing a distant sound. He looks directly into the camera.

And he waves.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - JOE)

[LOGIC - CRITICAL FAILURE]: IMPOSSIBLE. That is impossible. This is a VHS tape. It is not a live feed. My sense of reality is compromised.

[INLAND EMPIRE - SUCCESS]: Of course he‚Äôs waving. He‚Äôs waving at you. He knows you‚Äôre watching. The tape isn‚Äôt showing you the past. It‚Äôs showing you a connection.

NARRATOR
The world stirs. This is no longer a story being told to you. This is you. Your features, your choices, are now canon.

GAMEPLAY CHOICE:

PLAYER 1 (JOE): You‚Äôre staring at an impossible image. What is your immediate reaction?

OPTION 1: Eject the tape. This is wrong. You need to get out of here.
OPTION 2: Rewind the tape. See if he does it again.
OPTION 3: Call Newt. Immediately.

PLAYER 2 (NEWT): You‚Äôre at the bus stop, waiting. What do you do?

OPTION 1: Check your phone. See if Granny sent anything else.
OPTION 2: Call Joe. Tell him about the voice memo.
OPTION 3: Spark another blunt. Process the weirdness.

SCENE 2: THE CALL

(PLAYER 2 (NEWT) CHOOSES OPTION 2)

NARRATOR
The sky above Tuebrook is the colour of split concrete and spent thoughts. Newt slides his hand into his hoodie pocket, fishing out a battered pair of AirPods. One is scarred with tiny teeth marks‚ÄîDoobie‚Äôs doing, probably. He pops them in, one at a time, taps his phone screen with a flick of the thumb, and just like that‚Äî
bass.
Weight.
Sound.
A beat drops that feels like it was made just for this moment. Something grimy, reverb-soaked. Heavy kick, late snare. It cuts through the damp Liverpool air like it‚Äôs been waiting.

NEWT
(Muttering, a laugh caught in his throat)
Yeah. This is it.

He finds Joe's name in his contacts. The screen lights up. He presses call.

CUT TO: INT. HOME OFFICE, RECORDS ROOM

Joe is still staring at the frozen image of Newt waving on the CRT screen. His phone buzzes violently in his pocket. He pulls it out.

The caller ID reads: ‚ÄúNewtie üçÉüíø‚Äù

He blinks. A wire sparks in his brain. A paradox is forming.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - JOE)

[LOGIC - FAILED]: Wait. Wait a sec. Wasn‚Äôt I just with him? Like‚Äîjust now? With the tape?

[VOLITION - SHAKEN]: No. He‚Äôs on the screen. He‚Äôs on the phone. The two are separate. Get a grip.

[INLAND EMPIRE - TRIUMPHANT]: Or are they?

Joe pinches the bridge of his nose, whispering to the empty, dusty room.

JOE
Am I losing it or... is this, like... split?

He answers the call, his voice low and pulled tight with a tension he can‚Äôt name.

JOE (CONT'D)
Yo.

From the other side, through a thrilling fuzz of lo-fi static and heavy bass, Newt‚Äôs voice crackles in, buzzing with energy.

NEWT (ON PHONE)
Bro. You‚Äôre not gonna believe this, but Granny just sent me a fuckin‚Äô voice note about that street. Larkhill Lane. You know it?

There is a gut-wrenching pause. Joe‚Äôs breath catches in his throat. He swivels his chair, his eyes darting from the phone to the impossible text frozen on his work monitor: PROPERTY VERIFICATION ‚Äì SECTOR C-42, LARKHILL LANE.

JOE
(Voice slow, deliberate, heavy)
Yeah, mate. I‚Äôve got it right in front of me... but Newt... it‚Äôs not listed in the system anymore. Like‚Äîit‚Äôs been wiped. Only thing that‚Äôs left is this tape.

He looks down at the VHS clutched in his hand. It‚Äôs trembling. Or maybe he is.

NEWT (ON PHONE)
(A single, stark command)
Play it.

GAMEPLAY CHOICE:

PLAYER 1 (JOE): Newt‚Äôs command hangs in the air. The tape feels like it weighs a thousand pounds.

OPTION 1: [VOLITION] "No. Not until you're here. This is wrong."
OPTION 2: [SUGGESTION] "I'm leaving work. Come to mine. We do this together."
OPTION 3: [LOGIC] "Play it? Newt, it just showed you. Live. How is that possible?"

PLAYER 2 (NEWT): You've given your command. What's your follow-up?

OPTION 1: [RHETORIC] "Seriously, man, just press the button! What's the worst that could happen?"
OPTION 2: [EMPATHY] "You sound freaked. You good? What's on it?"
OPTION 3: [COMPOSURE] Wait for his response. Let the silence do the work.

SCENE 3: THE EXODUS

(PLAYER 1 (JOE) CHOOSES OPTION 2)

NARRATOR
Joe‚Äôs voice drops an octave, all traces of workplace apathy burned away by pure, undiluted seriousness. There‚Äôs no space left for banter.

JOE
Newt‚Äîlisten‚ÄîI need you to come over. Like, now. Bring the cats if you have to. I‚Äôm not watching this alone.

A sharpness is in his tone, a raw gravity that only emerges when the logical framework of his world begins to crack at the edges. He grips the phone tighter. With his other hand, he reaches for his Home Office lanyard and yanks it off his neck like it's on fire.

JOE (CONT'D)
(Voice firm, resolute)
I‚Äôm leaving the office. I don‚Äôt care. They can log it as annual leave or mental health or ghost tape stress‚ÄîI‚Äôm done for the day.

He grabs his coat, shoves the VHS tape into a beat-up tote bag, nestled between old case files and his lunch Tupperware. He strides down the corridor without making eye contact with anyone. No one stops him. No one even looks up from their screens. As he passes under a flickering fluorescent light, it buzzes and goes dark.

CUT TO: ON THE BUS

Newt is already moving. He swipes his bus pass and slides into a back seat. Rain taps against the window, a nervous, insistent rhythm trying to warn him of something. He adjusts his headphones, the bass still rumbling through his skull, but his fingers twitch with a mixture of excitement and dread.

NEWT
(Muttering into the phone)
Alright, alright‚ÄîI‚Äôm on my way. Don‚Äôt watch it ‚Äòtil I get there, yeah?

Joe‚Äôs voice comes back, quiet, but as solid as iron.

JOE (ON PHONE)
Wouldn‚Äôt dare.

NARRATOR
The scene shifts. Two vectors, now locked on a single point of convergence. Newt is on the 86 bus, hurtling toward the unknown. Joe is walking away from his life, into a strange static that hangs in the very air around him.

CUT TO: ON THE BUS

Newt‚Äôs mind is a frantic storm. The bass in his ears can‚Äôt drown out the confusion swelling in his chest. Words tumble out of his mouth, desperate to outrun his thoughts.

NEWT
Dude, fuckin'‚Äîhow the fuck, uh... how‚Äîwhere should I meet you, bro? Am I meeting you at your house? And by the way, I‚Äôve got weed, and I‚Äôve also got the cats, and dude, what the fuck is going on?

He pauses, his eyes darting to the rain-streaked window, watching the city blur into a meaningless smear of brick and light.

NEWT (CONT'D)
(Voice drops, suddenly vulnerable)
I don‚Äôt even remember how I got to Liverpool, if I‚Äôm being honest.

Gooby, in a battered cat carrier on the seat beside him, lets out a low, judgmental meow. Doobie is curled in Newt‚Äôs lap, utterly unbothered by the existential meltdown.

CUT TO: INT. JOE'S FLAT

Joe holds the phone to his ear with his shoulder as he fumbles with his keys. His voice is a strange cocktail of wired adrenaline and utter exasperation.

JOE
Yeah, come to mine. Just come straight. You know the way.

There's a beat as the key finally finds the lock.

JOE (CONT'D)
‚Ä¶Don‚Äôt worry about not remembering. Shit‚Äôs gone weird on my end too. The tape‚Ä¶ it showed you. Standing outside the shop. Like, just now. But the timestamp was from ten years ago.

The door creaks open. The flat smells of old fabric, dry cereal, and faint printer toner from his work-from-home setup. It‚Äôs a place where time never really got permission to move forward. Joe steps inside.

JOE (CONT'D)
(Muttering into the phone, conviction hardening his voice)
This whole thing‚ÄîLarkhill, Granny‚Äôs voice note, the cats, the fuckin‚Äô tape‚Äînone of it feels right. But it‚Äôs real. I can feel it. It‚Äôs real.

NEWT (ON PHONE)
(Voice a low mutter, swaying with the bus)
Swear down, man... if this turns into some Blair Witch/Truman Show crossover shit, I‚Äôm moving to fuckin‚Äô Iceland.

A dry, sharp laugh escapes Joe‚Äôs lips like steam from a pressurized valve.

JOE
Get here first. Then we watch it. Together.

(CLICK. The call ends.)

SCENE 4: THE PREPARATION

INT. JOE'S FLAT - AFTERNOON

GAME UI:

OBJECTIVE: PREPARE FOR CONVERGENCE.

STATUS: ANXIOUS.

NARRATOR
Joe‚Äôs inside now. Door shut. Jacket tossed on the back of a chair. He stands still for a moment in the centre of the room, eyes unfocused. The VHS tape sits like a dark accusation on the coffee table. His thoughts begin to spiral.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - JOE)

[LOGIC]: What does it mean to see someone live on a tape that‚Äôs supposed to be from a decade ago?

[INLAND EMPIRE]: How long has Larkhill Lane not been on the map? Since it was eaten? Since it was erased?

[VOLITION]: Did I even start work today‚Ä¶ or did today just start me?

He sits on the edge of the sofa, elbows on knees. The silence in the flat is thick, almost sticky. Then‚Äîa spark ignites in the fog of his mind. A moment of defiant clarity. He mutters aloud to the empty room, his eyes suddenly lighting up with purpose.

JOE
Nah, fuck this. If this tape‚Äôs about to ruin reality, I‚Äôm not facing it sober.

He grabs his slim HHC vape from the bookshelf and takes a slow, deliberate pull. The citrusy burn hits the back of his throat, trickling down into his chest like warm static. He exhales a long, thoughtful cloud of smoke.

JOE (CONT'D)
(Speaking to no one)
Right. Echo push. We‚Äôre doing this properly.

He fumbles through his phone's contacts, finds the name, and dials. It rings three times before a voice answers, devoid of all pleasantries.

DEALER (ON PHONE)
Standard or Chaos Bag?

Joe doesn't hesitate.

JOE
Chaos, bruv. Always chaos.

The drop is arranged. Fifteen minutes. Same lad from last time. Real reliable. Never asks questions.

EXT. JOE'S FLAT - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

The bus hisses to a stop down the road. Newt steps onto the pavement. Hoodie up. He holds the cat carrier awkwardly in one hand. Doobie is on a makeshift leash, walking beside him like she owns the entire estate. He pulls out his phone, redials Joe, and speaks loudly into the mic without waiting for an answer.

NEWT
Hey, my man, I‚Äôm fucking at yours. Open the door, yeah? Let me in, fam.

He hangs up. No ceremony.

INT. JOE'S FLAT

Joe hears Newt‚Äôs voice echo faintly through the cracked window. He‚Äôs still holding the vape, watching the orange LED glow on the end with the calm detachment of someone staring at a warning light in a car they no longer own. He exhales one last time and stands up. A faint smile plays on his lips.

JOE
(Whispering)
Time to roll into the weird.

He walks to the door, his hand already on the handle.

SCENE 5: THE RITUAL

INT. JOE'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM

NARRATOR
Joe bolts the door shut behind Newt with a heavy clunk that echoes off the walls. Without a word, he walks straight to the coffee table. This isn't a social call anymore. It's a ritual.

He retrieves two glass bongs. One is chipped at the base; the other has the faded remnants of a sticker that once read ‚ÄúBAD WIZARD.‚Äù He doesn't clean them. This isn‚Äôt a casual smoke. This is spiritual reconnaissance. He cracks open a battered tin. Inside is the Echo Kush‚Äîdense, crystalline, purple-tinged. It smells like forgotten drum kits and burnt orange peels. He meticulously grinds a fat gram into each bowl.

One for the now. One for what comes after.

He lights the first. The room hums. The air seems to bend. Time slows down‚Äînot as a metaphor, but literally. The screen of the powered-off television flickers with static. Joe leans back after the second rip, letting out a single cough. It‚Äôs not from harshness. It‚Äôs from disbelief. He feels himself melting into the fabric of the sofa.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - JOE)

[INLAND EMPIRE - ASCENDANT]: This is it. This is what consciousness looks like before it‚Äôs named. The raw code.

EXT. FRONT OF JOE'S FLAT - SAME TIME

Newt stands under the overhang of the porch, the cat carrier at his feet. A song is blasting straight through his brainstem. The AirPods are barely holding on.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - NEWT)

[COMPOSURE - FAILED]: Just stand here. Don't knock again. Be cool.

[INLAND EMPIRE - SUCCESS]: No. Wait. You‚Äôve gotta wait for this drop.

The bass hits like a physical revelation. And Newt dances. Not performatively. Not even rhythmically. It's just movement. Just truth through motion. Hips swaying, arms sketching invisible glyphs in the rain-washed air. Gooby meows from the carrier. Doobie watches with vague disdain.

Then, silence. The track ends. Reality rushes back in like a tide slapping a stoned monk. Newt blinks.

NEWT
(To himself)
Shit. I‚Äôve been here ages.

He turns and sees a tired old man in a tank top watching him from a neighbor's window, completely bemused. Newt holds up his small pouch of weed, smiling with zero shame.

NEWT (CONT'D)
Say your aye, mate? You want a bit?

The old man just waves a hand dismissively, as if brushing off a hallucination.

NEWT (CONT'D)
(Nodding respectfully)
Fair.

He scoops up the cats, opens Joe‚Äôs gate, and lets himself in‚Äîsoaking into the house like a drop of colour into water.

SCENE 6: THE CONFRONTATION

INT. JOE'S FLAT - THE ALCHEMY HOUR

NARRATOR
When Newt steps inside, there's a fun hit. It‚Äôs not just the leftover smoke, or the warm scent of hash and dust. It's the electric click of two minds, finally in the same chaotic space, syncing up.

Joe‚Äôs eyes are bloodshot. Newt‚Äôs pupils are blown wide. Both of them look like they‚Äôve seen things in dreams that the waking world hasn't earned yet.

They just stand there.

Joe, slouched into the sofa, looking like the fabric is trying to absorb him. Newt, standing in the doorway, hoodie damp, phone dark. Time folds in on itself. One second. Five. Twenty.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - JOE)

[EMPATHY]: He looks older. But it‚Äôs only been a week. Or a day. Or a lifetime since I saw him last. He‚Äôs scared. Just like me.

(INTERNAL MONOLOGUE - NEWT)

[ESPRIT DE CORPS]: This feels like the part right before a boss fight. Or a hug. Or both. Whatever it is, we‚Äôre in it together.

The stare is broken not by a word, but by an offering. Joe shifts, his joints creaking. He reaches for one of the packed bongs and holds it out. His eyes are glassy, but behind the haze is a kind of sacred urgency. His voice is thick, heavy, and full of a terrible reverence.

JOE
Two hits, mate. That‚Äôs all it‚Äôll take. Did me in. This isn‚Äôt regular smoke... this is, like... memory resin, or some ancient botanical god.

His face twists, not a smile, but a grimace of profound awe.

JOE (CONT'D)
It talked to me, Newt. While I was in it. Not with words. With... shapes. Concepts. Made me feel like I was older than my own bloodline.

Newt steps forward, letting the door click shut. He sets the cat carrier down. Doobie slinks out like a small monochrome panther. Gooby emerges more cautiously, sniffing the air as if searching for the edge of the simulation. Newt takes the bong gently, ceremonially, like he‚Äôs just been handed the Ark of the Covenant. He grins, his eyes wide, his voice light but twitching with manic energy.

NEWT
Alright then, wizard man. Let‚Äôs see what the fuck this ‚Äòconcept smoke‚Äô is sayin‚Äô, yeah?

He packs twin bowls, each with a full gram of Echo Kush. The green sparkles under the dim light, like it's holding ultraviolet secrets. He lights. Inhales. Holds. Time dilates. His body loosens, and his mind unzips like a suitcase packed too tight.

(INSIDE NEWT‚ÄôS MIND ‚Äì THE DISCORDIAN STAGE)

[A courtroom. A rave. A s√©ance. All at once.]

Newt stands in the centre, surrounded by a thousand versions of himself, all arguing. One wears a crown of tangled MIDI cables. One is shirtless, screaming about universal frequencies. One is just Gooby the cat, smoking a tiny joint and whispering in Latin.

An internal judge, whose face is a spinning record, bangs a broken sampler like a gavel.

THE JUDGE: Order! This man is high as FUCK.

Back in Joe‚Äôs living room, Newt bursts out laughing, a wild, unhinged sound.

NEWT (CONT'D)
Ohhh, shit. Shit. Yo... I just... I saw the idea of jazz, bro.

Then, just as quickly, he turns serious. His pupils are huge, black moons. He lifts the VHS tape from the table. It feels heavier than it looks. Colder. The label still reads: DO NOT WATCH ALONE. He holds it like a cursed totem and turns to Joe, his voice cracking with too much emotion and zero stability.

NEWT (CONT'D)
What the fuck is this, bro? What is goin‚Äô on with this shit, huh?

He stares at Joe. And for a second‚Äîa flicker in the haze‚ÄîJoe doesn't look like Joe. And Newt doesn't look like Newt. The features have blurred, swapped. It‚Äôs like identity itself just flipped inside out.

At that exact moment, Gooby and Doobie meow in perfect, chilling unison. A weird, harmonic chime that cuts through the thick air. The room crackles. The tape is still unplayed.

And now, it feels like it's watching them.

GAMEPLAY CHOICE:

The moment is here. The final threshold.

PLAYER 1 (JOE) / PLAYER 2 (NEWT):

OPTION 1: [VOLITION] Press Play. No more questions. No more delays. Face the abyss. Together.

OPTION 2: [LOGIC] Question it more. "Before we do anything, let's go over everything one more time. Your Granny. My work file. The tape showing you live."

OPTION 3: [INLAND EMPIRE] Try to communicate with the tape. Hold it. Talk to it. Ask it what it wants.

OPTION 4: [PHYSICAL INSTRUMENT] Destroy it. "Fuck this. This thing is evil. We need to burn it. Now."

```
