# The Echo Tape

**The Echo Tape** is an experimental interactive story told entirely in the browser. Each episode unfolds like a choose‑your‑own‑adventure, letting you guide the characters through multiple paths. This was a story that me and my best friend came up with. To be used as both a learning tool and to tell a story.

Episode 1 is still in development and not yet fully playable. It currently includes sound effects and a scene history overlay. Game progress is saved in your browser using local storage. Episode 2 is currently in development.
