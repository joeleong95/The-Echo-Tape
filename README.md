# The Echo Tape

Welcome to **The Echo Tape**, an experimental interactive story built for the browser. The project is still in its infancyâ€”Episode 1 contains less than ten percent of the planned content.

Most documentation lives in [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). Head there for details on running the game, writing episodes and contributing.
See [docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow examples and contributor tips.

## Quick Start

1. Install **Node.js 18** or higher.
2. Run `npm install` to grab dependencies.
3. Start the local server with `npm start` and open the printed URL in your browser.
4. Use `npm test` and `npm run lint` to verify changes.
5. When editing any `episodes/*.json`, run `npm run build-episodes` before testing.
