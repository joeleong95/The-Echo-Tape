# Episode Builder

This standalone Node.js utility helps authors create new episode JSON files.
Run `npm start` inside this folder and follow the prompts. The tool writes the
resulting file to `../episodes/` so it can be loaded by the game.

The CLI now provides a short writing primer and offers a template snippet for
each scene. Simply press <kbd>Enter</kbd> when asked for the HTML to insert the
example layout using the project's dialogue and choice styles.
